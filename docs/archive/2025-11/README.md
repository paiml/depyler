## Context
These files were part of a "STOP THE LINE" event in early November 2025. The blocking issues were successfully resolved, and the project has since moved to high-velocity execution mode with strong TDD discipline.

As of Nov 24, the project status is:
- ✅ 545/545 unit tests passing
- ✅ Multiple features shipped (DEPYLER-0500 through DEPYLER-0514)
- ✅ All quality gates passing
- 🟢 Project health: HEALTHY

These files were archived per recommendation from thrashing audit (Nov 24) to prevent confusion.
