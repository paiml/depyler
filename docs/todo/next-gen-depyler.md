## Implementation & Release Workflow

### Systematic Priority Implementation

After completing all documentation and task granularization, follow this systematic approach:

#### For Each Priority Level (1-7):

1. **Implementation Phase**
   - [ ] Create feature branch for the priority (e.g., `priority-1-critical-fixes`)
   - [ ] Implement all tasks and sub-tasks for the current priority
   - [ ] Follow TDD: write tests first, then implementation
   - [ ] Ensure each commit represents a complete, working feature
   - [ ] Document each implementation with inline comments and examples

2. **Quality Control Phase**
   - [ ] Run full test suite: `cargo test --workspace`
   - [ ] Verify clippy compliance: `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
   - [ ] Check code coverage: ensure >90% for new code
   - [ ] Run benchmarks: `cargo bench` - ensure no performance regression
   - [ ] Verify documentation: `cargo doc --no-deps --open`
   - [ ] Test all examples: `cargo run --example <name>` for each
   - [ ] Run property-based tests with increased iterations
   - [ ] Perform manual testing of edge cases

3. **Integration Verification**
   - [ ] Test with real Python codebases
   - [ ] Verify generated Rust code compiles without warnings
   - [ ] Run semantic equivalence tests
   - [ ] Check binary size remains under targets
   - [ ] Verify MCP integration still works
   - [ ] Test CLI with all new features

4. **Release Preparation**
   - [ ] Update version in all `Cargo.toml` files
   - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes
   - [ ] Create release notes highlighting new features
   - [ ] Update README.md with new capabilities
   - [ ] Update documentation and examples
   - [ ] Tag release candidate: `git tag -a v1.X.0-rc1`

5. **GitHub Release**
   - [ ] Create pull request from feature branch
   - [ ] Ensure all CI checks pass
   - [ ] Perform code review
   - [ ] Merge to main branch
   - [ ] Create GitHub release with notes
   - [ ] Attach pre-built binaries for major platforms

6. **Crates.io Publication**
   - [ ] Dry run: `cargo publish --dry-run -p <crate-name>`
   - [ ] Publish in dependency order:
     1. `cargo publish -p depyler-annotations`
     2. `cargo publish -p depyler-core`
     3. `cargo publish -p depyler-analyzer`
     4. `cargo publish -p depyler-verify`
     5. `cargo publish -p depyler-quality`
     6. `cargo publish -p depyler-mcp`
     7. `cargo publish -p depyler-wasm`
     8. `cargo publish -p depyler`
   - [ ] Verify crates.io listing shows correctly
   - [ ] Test installation: `cargo install depyler`

7. **Post-Release Verification**
   - [ ] Monitor issue tracker for immediate problems
   - [ ] Check download statistics
   - [ ] Gather user feedback
   - [ ] Create hotfix branch if critical issues found
   - [ ] Plan next priority implementation

### Priority Implementation Order

1. **Priority 1 - Critical Fixes** (v1.0.1 - v1.0.3)
   - Type inference & ownership fixes

### Release Cadence

- **Patch releases** (x.x.1): Every 1-2 weeks for bug fixes
- **Minor releases** (x.1.0): Every 4-6 weeks for new features
- **Major releases** (2.0.0): When breaking changes or major features land

### Quality Gates for Each Release

Must pass ALL before release:
- [ ] 100% of tests passing
- [ ] Zero clippy warnings with pedantic lints
- [ ] Code coverage >85% overall, >90% for new code
- [ ] All examples compile and run correctly
- [ ] Documentation builds without warnings
- [ ] Benchmarks show <5% performance regression
- [ ] Binary size within 10% of target
- [ ] Successful test on 3 real Python projects
- [ ] MCP integration tests passing
- [ ] Cross-platform CI fully green

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered post-release:
1. Immediately yank affected crates.io versions
2. Create hotfix branch from last stable tag
3. Apply minimal fix with comprehensive tests
4. Fast-track through abbreviated QC process
5. Release as patch version
6. Communicate clearly with users about the issue

## Next Steps

1. **Complete documentation** - Finish expanding priorities 4-7 with granular tasks
2. **Set up release automation** - GitHub Actions for release workflow
3. **Begin Priority 1** - Start with critical type inference fixes
4. **Establish baseline** - Current performance and quality metrics
5. **Community engagement** - Announce systematic improvement plan

This systematic approach ensures each release is stable, well-tested, and provides incremental value to users while maintaining the 自働化 (Jidoka) principle: build quality in, never ship incomplete transpilation.
