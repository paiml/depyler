## Test Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Module:
1. **Unit Tests**: Cover all public functions and important private ones
2. **Doctests**: Add examples to all public APIs
3. **Property Tests**: Create at least 2-3 property tests per module
4. **Examples**: Create realistic usage examples
5. **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions

### Test Quality Requirements:
- Each test should be meaningful (no trivial tests)
- Tests should cover edge cases
- Property tests should use realistic inputs
- Examples should demonstrate real-world usage
- Doctests should be educational

### Coverage Targets by Phase:
- Phase 1: +230 lines (~0.8% increase)
- Phase 2: +693 lines (~2.4% increase)
- Phase 3: +570 lines (~2.0% increase)
- Phase 4: +2,360 lines (~8.2% increase)
- Phase 5: +742 lines (~2.6% increase)
- Phase 6: +434 lines (~1.5% increase)
- Phase 7: +478 lines (~1.7% increase)

**Total Expected Coverage Increase**: ~19.2% (from 63.86% to ~83%)

## Execution Order
1. Start with Phase 1 (quick wins) to build momentum
2. Move to Phase 2-3 (WASM and Interactive) for user-facing features
3. Tackle Phase 4 (Core) for maximum impact
4. Complete Phase 5-7 to reach and exceed 80%

## Success Metrics
- Line coverage â‰¥ 80%
- All new tests pass
- No regression in existing tests
- Documentation coverage increases
- Examples compile and run
