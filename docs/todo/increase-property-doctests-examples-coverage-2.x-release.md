# Increase Property Tests, Doctests, Examples, and Coverage for 2.x Release

## Overview

The Depyler transpiler has sophisticated testing infrastructure but severely underutilizes it. This document outlines a comprehensive plan to bring testing coverage to an acceptable level for a production-quality transpiler.

## Current State

- **Property Tests**: Only 4 basic property tests with 10-20 iterations each
- **Doctests**: Minimal documentation with examples
- **Coverage**: ~60% (should be 85%+ for critical infrastructure)
- **Examples**: Limited real-world usage examples

## Target Goals

- **Property Tests**: 50+ comprehensive property tests covering all critical paths
- **Doctests**: Every public API with usage examples
- **Coverage**: 85% minimum, 95% for core transpilation logic
- **Examples**: 20+ real-world examples showcasing different features
