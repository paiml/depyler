# v3.19.1 Precision Coverage Plan - Reach 80% Target

**Goal**: Close 2.34% gap (77.66% → 80.00%)
**Approach**: Precision targeting of highest-impact modules
**Duration**: 3-4 hours
**Tests**: ~8-10 targeted tests

## Target Modules (Ranked by Impact)

### Priority 1: Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Impact)

1. **import_gen.rs** (60.00%, 28 missed lines)
   - Effort: 30 minutes
   - Tests: 2 unit tests
   - Focus: Import organization edge cases
   - Expected gain: +0.12%

2. **context.rs** (65.71%, 12 missed lines)
   - Effort: 20 minutes
   - Tests: 1 unit test
   - Focus: Context initialization paths
   - Expected gain: +0.05%

3. **func_gen.rs** (68.98%, 170 missed lines)
   - Effort: 1 hour
   - Tests: 3 unit tests
   - Focus: Generic parameter generation, lifetime handling
   - Expected gain: +0.70%

### Priority 2: Medium Impact

4. **stmt_gen.rs** (82.27%, 100 missed lines)
   - Effort: 45 minutes
   - Tests: 2 unit tests
   - Focus: Exception handling edge cases, context managers
   - Expected gain: +0.41%

5. **type_mapper.rs** (74.62%, 165 missed lines)
   - Effort: 45 minutes
   - Tests: 2 unit tests
   - Focus: Complex type mappings, generic resolution
   - Expected gain: +0.68%

### Total Estimated Impact

- **Effort**: 3h 20min
- **Tests**: 10 tests
- **Expected Coverage Gain**: +1.96% (brings us to 79.62%)
- **Additional buffer work**: Target specific lines for final 0.38%

## Test Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1h) ✅ COMPLETE
- import_gen.rs tests (13 comprehensive tests) ✅
- context.rs tests (16 comprehensive tests) ✅
- Verify +0.17% gain (pending coverage analysis)

### Phase 2: High Impact (2h)
- func_gen.rs tests (generics, lifetimes)
- stmt_gen.rs tests (exceptions, context managers)
- Verify +1.11% gain (cumulative 1.28%)

### Phase 3: Precision Strike (30min)
- type_mapper.rs tests (complex types)
- Verify +0.68% gain (cumulative 1.96%)

### Phase 4: Final Push (30min)
- Analyze remaining gap
- Add 1-2 targeted tests for specific lines
- Verify ≥80% achieved

## Success Criteria

✅ Coverage ≥80.00%
✅ All tests passing (no regressions)
✅ Zero clippy warnings
✅ Complexity ≤10 for all new code
✅ Tests follow best practices (focused, minimal)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Coverage attribution may distribute gains
- **Mitigation**: Target direct function calls, not integration paths
- **Backup Plan**: If gains don't materialize, add property tests to high-value functions
