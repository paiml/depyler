## Work Breakdown

### Phase 1: Security Remediation (6-8 hours) ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

#### Problem Statement

**RUSTSEC-2025-0003**: fast-float 0.2.0 - Segmentation fault due to lack of bound check
- **Impact**: Critical - Can cause segfaults in production
- **Path**: polars (via depyler-ruchy)
- **Status**: No fixed upgrade available yet

**RUSTSEC-2025-0057**: fxhash - unmaintained
- **Impact**: Medium - No new features/fixes
- **Path**: sled â†’ pmat â†’ depyler-mcp

**RUSTSEC-2024-0384**: instant - unmaintained
- **Impact**: Low - Maintained alternative exists (web-time)
- **Path**: parking_lot â†’ sled â†’ pmat

#### Solution Options

**Option A: Update Dependencies** (RECOMMENDED - 4-6 hours)
1. **Polars Update**
   - Check if newer polars (0.50.0+) uses fast-float2 or safer alternative
   - Current: Using polars 0.50.0, but fast-float 0.2.0 still in tree
   - Action: Investigate dependency tree, file issue if needed

2. **Replace fxhash** (2 hours)
   - Migrate to `rustc-hash` (maintained alternative)
   - Update sled/pmat if needed
   - Test performance impact (fxhash is fast)

3. **Replace instant** (1 hour)
   - Already documented in previous releases
   - Use `web-time` crate (maintained)
   - Update parking_lot dependency

**Option B: Cargo Deny Policy** (1-2 hours)
- Add `deny.toml` with advisory policy
- Block critical/high vulnerabilities
- Allow documented warnings with mitigation

**Option C: Isolate Vulnerable Code** (2-3 hours)
- Move polars usage to optional feature
- Only enable in depyler-ruchy (experimental)
- Document risk for ruchy users

#### Recommended Approach
Combination of A + B:
1. Update dependencies where possible
2. Add cargo-deny policy for ongoing protection
3. Document remaining risks

#### Files to Modify
- `Cargo.toml` (workspace) - Update dependencies
- `deny.toml` (new) - Security policy
- `docs/security.md` (new) - Security documentation

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] All warnings documented with mitigation
- [ ] Cargo-deny policy in place
- [ ] All 697 tests passing

---

### Phase 2: Error Diagnostics (4-6 hours) ðŸŸ¡ HIGH VALUE

#### Problem Statement

Current error messages are developer-focused, not user-friendly:

```
error: Type mismatch in function return
Expected: String
Found: &str
```

**Target**: Elm-style errors with context and suggestions:

```
â”€â”€ TYPE MISMATCH â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

The return type annotation says this function returns String:

    5| def process_text(text: str) -> str:
                                     ^^^

But the body returns &str:

    6|     return text.upper()
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

String transformation methods (.upper(), .lower(), .strip()) return
owned String in Rust, not borrowed &str.

Hint: The transpiler generates `String` for this case automatically.
This is expected behavior and should compile correctly.
```

#### Solution Implemented

1. **Error Context Tracking** (2-3 hours)
   - Add span information to HIR nodes
   - Track source locations through pipeline
   - Generate source snippets with highlighting

2. **Error Templates** (1-2 hours)
   - Common error types:
     - Type mismatches (return type, parameter type, assignment)
     - Lifetime errors (borrowed vs owned)
     - Missing type annotations
     - Unsupported Python features
   - Elm-style formatting with â”€â”€, ^^^, and colors

3. **Suggestion Engine** (1-2 hours)
   - Analyze error context
   - Suggest fixes:
     - "Add type annotation: `def foo(x: int)`"
     - "Use `.to_string()` to convert &str â†’ String"
     - "This Python feature isn't supported yet. Try: ..."

#### Files to Modify
- `crates/depyler-core/src/errors.rs` (new) - Error types and formatting
- `crates/depyler-core/src/hir.rs` - Add span information
- `crates/depyler-core/src/rust_gen.rs` - Use new error system

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Top 10 common errors have Elm-style messages
- [ ] Errors include source context and suggestions
- [ ] User testing shows improved error clarity

---

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Improvements (6-10 hours) ðŸŸ¢ QUALITY

#### Current State

Coverage: 62.68% overall
- **Good**: depyler-core (likely 80%+), depyler-verify (61-97%)
- **Poor**: depyler-ruchy (0.94-43%), agent modules (0%), interactive (2.35%)

#### Strategy

Focus on core modules first (highest ROI):

1. **depyler-core Coverage** (3-4 hours)
   - Target: 85%+ line coverage
   - Focus: v3.16.0 new code (string methods, division, Cow)
   - Add unit tests for edge cases
   - Add integration tests for showcase examples

2. **depyler-verify Coverage** (2-3 hours)
   - Target: 80%+ line coverage
   - Focus: Property verification, contract verification
   - Add tests for lifetime_analysis (currently 31.15%)
   - Add tests for memory_safety (currently 46.91%)

3. **Property Tests** (1-2 hours)
   - String method return types (random methods)
   - Division semantics (random int/float combinations)
   - String optimization (random usage patterns)

4. **Skip Low-Value Modules**
   - depyler-ruchy: Experimental, low priority
   - agent/*: Runtime services, hard to test
   - interactive.rs: User-facing, manual testing OK

#### Files to Add
- `tests/transpilation/string_methods_properties.rs` (new)
- `tests/transpilation/division_edge_cases.rs` (new)
- `tests/verify/lifetime_analysis_tests.rs` (new)

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Overall coverage â‰¥80%
- [ ] Core modules â‰¥85%
- [ ] All v3.16.0 features have property tests

---

### Phase 4: Transpiler Modularity (4-6 hours) ðŸŸ¢ TECHNICAL DEBT

#### Problem Statement

Current transpiler is monolithic:
- `rust_gen.rs` is 4000+ lines
- Hard to test individual components
- Difficult to extend with new features

#### Solution

Extract modules:

1. **String Handling Module** (2 hours)
   - Extract string optimization logic
   - Extract string method conversion
   - Separate concerns: analysis vs codegen

2. **Type Conversion Module** (2 hours)
   - Extract type mapping logic
   - Extract lifetime analysis
   - Create testable boundaries

3. **Expression Generation Module** (2 hours)
   - Extract binary operations
   - Extract method calls
   - Modular, composable functions

#### Files to Create
- `crates/depyler-core/src/string_codegen.rs` (new)
- `crates/depyler-core/src/type_conversion.rs` (new)
- `crates/depyler-core/src/expr_codegen.rs` (new)

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] rust_gen.rs reduced to <2000 lines
- [ ] Each module has clear responsibilities
- [ ] All modules independently testable

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing
```bash
# Run security audit
cargo audit

# Check deny policy
cargo deny check

# Verify no regressions
cargo test --workspace
```

### Error Message Testing
```bash
# Intentionally create type errors
depyler transpile tests/error_cases/*.py

# Verify error messages are helpful
# Manual review for clarity
```

### Coverage Testing
```bash
# Generate coverage report
cargo llvm-cov --html --open

# Verify targets
# - Overall: â‰¥80%
# - Core modules: â‰¥85%
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Dependency updates** - May break existing code
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing, gradual rollout
   - Fallback: Pin to known-good versions

2. **Error system refactor** - May affect all error paths
   - Mitigation: Incremental migration
   - Fallback: Keep old error system as backup

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Coverage improvements** - Time-consuming
   - Mitigation: Focus on high-value areas first
   - Fallback: Accept 70%+ if 80% is unrealistic

### Low Risk Items
1. **Modularity refactor** - Internal change
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing
   - Fallback: Easily reversible
