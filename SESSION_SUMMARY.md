## 🚀 **Next Steps (Sprint 2)**

### **Immediate Actions** (PRIORITY):

1. **Start DEPYLER-0004**: Refactor generate_rust_file
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Write property tests FIRST
   # Step 2: Apply Extract Method pattern
   # Step 3: Verify complexity ≤10
   # Step 4: Maintain TDG A+ score
   ```

2. **TDD Workflow**:
   - Write failing test first (RED)
   - Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN)
   - Refactor with complexity ≤10 (REFACTOR)
   - Verify with `pmat tdg <file> --include-components`

3. **Quality Gates** (Before Every Commit):
   ```bash
   pmat tdg . --min-grade A-
   pmat analyze complexity <file> --max-cyclomatic 10
   cargo test --workspace
   cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
   ```

---

## 🔧 **Development Workflow (MANDATORY)**

### **Before Starting Work**:
```bash
1. Check roadmap: docs/execution/roadmap.md
2. Select ticket: DEPYLER-XXXX
3. Run baseline: pmat tdg . --min-grade A-
```

### **During Development**:
```bash
1. Write test FIRST (TDD)
2. Implement with complexity ≤10
3. Verify: pmat analyze complexity <file>
4. Check: cargo test
```

### **Before Commit**:
```bash
1. Update roadmap.md or CHANGELOG.md
2. Run: git add .
3. Run: git commit -m "[DEPYLER-XXXX] Description"
4. Pre-commit hook runs automatically (BLOCKS if fails)
```
