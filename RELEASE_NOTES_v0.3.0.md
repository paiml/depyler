- **Testability Score**: Tracks test coverage and property verification
- **Target TDG Score**: < 2.0 (achieved: 1.8)

### 🛠️ Developer Experience Enhancements

#### Improved Error Messages

```rust
// Before:
Error: Type mismatch

// After:
Error: Type mismatch in function 'calculate_sum'
  --> input.py:5:12
   |
 5 |     result = x + "string"
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Cannot add `int` and `str`
   |
   = help: Consider converting to the same type:
           result = x + int("string")  # Convert string to int
           result = str(x) + "string"  # Convert int to string
```

#### CI/CD Improvements

- **Multi-Platform Builds**: Automated releases for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Binary Size Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of release binary sizes
- **Quality Gates**: Enforced PMAT scores, test coverage, and complexity limits
- **Deterministic Builds**: Reproducible builds across all platforms

## 💔 Breaking Changes

### API Changes

- `TranspileOptions::verify` now requires a `VerificationLevel` enum instead of
  bool
- Removed deprecated `transpile_with_options()` - use
  `Transpiler::new().transpile()`
- Changed `EnergyEstimate` struct to include confidence intervals

### CLI Changes

- `--verify` flag now requires a value: `basic`, `standard`, or `strict`
- Removed `--experimental-async` flag (async support now standard)
- Changed default output directory from `./output` to `./rust_output`

---

## 📚 Migration Guide from v0.2.0

### 1. Update CLI Commands

```bash
# Old (v0.2.0):
depyler transpile input.py --verify

# New (v0.3.0):
depyler transpile input.py --verify standard
```

### 2. Update API Usage

```rust
// Old (v0.2.0):
let options = TranspileOptions {
    verify: true,
    ..Default::default()
};

// New (v0.3.0):
let options = TranspileOptions {
    verify: VerificationLevel::Standard,
    ..Default::default()
};
```

### 3. Update Configuration Files

```toml
# .depyler.toml
[transpile]
# Old:
verify = true

# New:
verify = "standard"  # Options: "basic", "standard", "strict"
```

### 4. Leverage New Features

Try the Interactive Playground for instant feedback:

```bash
# Open playground with your code
depyler playground --file examples/my_code.py

# Or visit the web version
open https://playground.depyler.io
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues and Limitations

### Interactive Playground

- First-time load requires downloading ~21MB of WASM toolchain
- Safari may have reduced performance compared to Chrome/Firefox
- Code execution limited to 5 seconds to prevent infinite loops
- Network APIs disabled in sandbox for security

### Transpilation

- Async generators still experimental
- Complex metaclass patterns not fully supported
- Some NumPy operations require manual annotation
- F-strings with complex expressions may need simplification

### Platform-Specific

- Windows: Long path names may cause issues (use short paths)
- macOS: First run may trigger security dialogs
- Linux: Requires glibc 2.17+ (most modern distros compatible)
